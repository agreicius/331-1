    <title>Group rings, polynomials, power series</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            In this section and the next we introduce three ring constructions: group rings, polynomial (and power series) rings, and Hamilton quaternion rings. Each of these uses as an underlying set a collection of <q>formal sums</q> with coefficients in a base ring <m>R</m>. This somewhat ambiguous language of formal sums comes up frequently in mathematics. As we make official with <xref ref="fiat_formal_sums"/> a formal sum is really just a tuple that we have decided to write using summation notation. The definition of the complex numbers is a typical example of this phenomenon: complex numbers are usually defined as a formal sum <m>a+bi</m> where <m>a,b\in \R</m>, when in essence a complex number is just a pair <m>(a,b)\in \R^2</m>. Why not just use tuple notation? We tend to reach for the formal sum notation in situations where there is a (well-behaved) multiplication defined on our tuples, which further more respects the component-wise addition of these tuples. In these situations algebraic manipulation often proceeds more smoothly with the formal sum representation of objects, as opposed to the tuple representation.

            <title>Formal sums are tuples</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Let <m>R</m> be a ring, and let <m>J</m> be a nonempty set. A <em>formal sum</em> of the form 
                    <me>
                        \sum_{j\in J}a_j\, j
                    </me>
                    is just alternative notation for the tuple <m>(a_j)_{j\in J}</m>. As a very important consequence of this identification, formal sums inherit a coefficient-wise notion of equality from tuples. That is,  we have 
                    <md>
                        <mrow>\sum_{j\in J}a_j\, j=\sum_{j\in J}b_j\, j \amp \iff (a_j)_{j\in J}=(b_j)_{j\in J} </mrow>
                        <mrow> \amp \iff a_j=b_j \text{ for all } j\in J</mrow>
                    </md>.
                   As a form of shortening, when expanding out a formal sum <m>\sum_{j\in J}a_j j</m> we will often drop terms where <m>a_j=0</m>. Similarly, we sometimes drop the <m>1</m> in an expression like <m>1\, j</m>, writing just <m>j</m> instead.

    <statement>
    <p>
    Let <m>R</m> be a nontrivial commutative ring, and let <m>G</m> be a finite group. We define <m>R\, G</m> to be the set of all formal sums 
    <me>
        \sum_{g\in G}a_g g
    </me>,
    where <m>a_g\in R</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>, and we define binary operations <m>+</m> and <m>\cdot</m> as follows: 
    <md>
        <mrow>\sum_{g\in G}a_g g+\sum_{g\in G}b_g g \amp =\sum_{g\in G}(a_g+b_g) g </mrow>

    The triple <m>(R\, G, +, \cdot)</m> is a ring called the <term>group ring</term> of <m>G</m> with coefficients in <m>R</m>. The additive and multiplicative identities of <m>R</m> are given as

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                The subset <m>\{re\mid r\in R\}</m> is easily seen to be a subring of <m>R\, G</m>. Indeed, using the definition of the group ring operations, we see that
                <md>
                    <mrow>re + se \amp = (r+s) e </mrow>
                    <mrow>re\cdot se \amp =(rs) e</mrow>
                </md>.
                Thus we can think of the subring <m>\{re\mid r\in R\}</m> as a copy of <m>R</m> living as a subset of <m>R\, G</m>. (Later we will be able to say that this subring is <em>isomorphic</em> to <m>R</m>.)  By slight abuse of notation, we will identify <m>R</m> with this subring of <m>R\, G</m>, and sometimes drop the <m>e</m> from the notation <m>r\, e</m>. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                From the group ring operations definition, it follows that 
                <md>
                    <mrow>r\, e \cdot \left(\sum_{g\in G}a_g\, g \right)\amp =\sum_{g\in G}ra_g\, g</mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp =\left(\sum_{g\in G}a_g\, g\right) \cdot r\, e</mrow>
                </md>.
                Identifying <m>R</m> with <m>\{re\mid r\in R\}</m>, we see that <m>R\leq Z(R)</m>. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                We can also think of the group <m>G</m> as sitting inside <m>R\, G</m>, using the identification 
                <md>
                    <mrow>g \amp =1\, g+\sum_{h\ne g}0\, h</mrow>
                </md>.
                We call such elements of <m>R\, G</m> <term>group elements</term>. 
                With this identification in place, we that the ring multiplication on <m>R\, G</m> extends the group operation of <m>G</m>. That is, given <m>g,h\in G</m>, identifying these as the ring elements <m>1\, g</m> and <m>1\, h</m> and taking their product, we see that 
                <md>
                    <mrow>g\cdot h \amp = gh </mrow>
                </md>.
                As a result, it is easy to see that a group element <m>g\in R\, G</m> is invertible with inverse the group element <m>g^{-1}</m>. It follows that we can think of <m>G</m> as a subgroup of the group of units of <m>R\, G</m> (with respect to our identification): <ie/>, 
                <md>
                  <mrow>  G\leq (R\, G)^* \amp </mrow>
                </md>.

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Combining the previous observations, we can now give a decent motivation for the multiplication operation on <m>R\, G</m>. Namely, it is the unique binary operation on <m>R\, G</m> satisfying the following properties:
                <ol>
                    
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            it distributes over the given addition operation on <m>R\, G</m>; 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            it extends the group operation in the sense that <m>g\cdot h=gh</m>;
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            we have <m>r\, e\in Z(R\, G)</m> for all <m>r\in R</m> with respect to this multiplication.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                In this sense our multiplication operation is the unique way of extending the group operation of <m>G</m> to a ring operation on <m>R\, G</m> in such a way that our copy of <m>R\leq R\, G</m> lies in the center of <m>R\, G</m>.

        When computing an explicit product in a group ring, instead of using the formal definition in <xref ref="spec_group_rings"/>, it is usually easiest to expand out using distributivity, use the fact that the ring coefficients commute with everything and that the ring product of group elements is given by the group product, and the collect like terms.

Since <m>r+r^2=r(e+r)  </m>, it suffices to show that <m>e+r</m> is a unit of <m>\F_3\, D_3</m>. (If <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are units, then so is <m>ab</m>.)

    Let <m>K</m> be a field, and let <m>G=\{g_1,g_2,\dots, g_n\}</m> be a group of cardinality <m>n</m>. In this case the group ring <m>K\, G</m> has the additional structure of a <m>K</m>-vector space, where vector addition is just the ring addition, and scalar multiplication by an element <m>c\in K</m> is defined as ring multiplication by the element <m>c\, e\in K\, G</m>. In fact, identifying elements of <m>K\, G</m> as tuples via the correspondence

        Whereas normally power series are introduced as a sort of generalization of polynomials, we will take the approach of defining the notion of a ring of power series, and identify a subring as the ring of polynomials.

    Let <m>R</m> be a nontrivial commutative ring. We define the set <m>R[[x]]</m> to be the set of all formal sums of the form
    <md>
        <mrow> \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n x^n \amp </mrow>
    </md>,
    where <m>a_n\in R</m> for all <m>n\in \Z_{\geq 0}</m>, and we define binary operations <m>+</m> and <m>\cdot</m> as follows: 
    <md>
        <mrow>\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n+\sum_{n=0}^\infty b_nx^n \amp = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (a_n+b_n)x^n</mrow>
        <mrow>\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n\cdot \sum_{n=0}^\infty b_nx^n \amp = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_nx^n \amp c_n=\sum_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}</mrow>
    </md>.
    The triple <m>(R[[x]], +,\cdot)</m> is a commutative ring called the <term>power series ring over (or with coefficients in) <m>R</m> in the unknown (or indeterminate) <m>x</m></term>. The additive and multiplicative identities of <m>R[[x]]</m> are given as
    <md number="yes">
        <mrow>0 \amp =\sum_{n=0}^\infty 0x^n = 0+0x+0x^2+\cdots </mrow>
        <mrow>1 \amp =1x^0+\sum_{n=1}^\infty 0x^n =1+0x+0x^2+\cdots </mrow>

  Given a power series <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty</m>, we call <m>a_nx^n</m> its <term><m>n</m>-th term</term>, and <m>a_n</m> its  <term><m>n</m>-th coefficient</term>.
    </p>
<p> 
    We will use function-like notation to name power series. In more detail, we will refer to power series using function letters like <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>, and will write <m>f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx_n</m> when explicitly introducing names of coefficients.

        <title>Power series equality</title>

        When are two power series <m>f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n</m> and <m>g(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty b_nx^n</m> equal? Identifying these formal sums as tuples <m>(a_n)_{n=0}^\infty</m>, <m>(b_n)_{n=0}^\infty</m>, following <xref ref="fiat_formal_sums"/>, we see that 
        <md number="no">

        We now identify the ring <m>R[x]</m> of polynomials over <m>R</m> as the subring of <m>R[[x]]</m> consisting of all power series whose coefficients are <q>eventually</q> equal to zero.

    <activity xml:id="spec_poly_ring">

    <statement>
   <p>
  Let <m>R</m> be a nontrivial commutative ring.
  Define the <term>polynomial ring over <m>R</m> in the indeterminate <m>x</m></term> to be the subset <m>R[x]\subseteq R[[x]]</m> of all power series whose coefficients are <em>eventually</em> equal to zero: i.e., 
  <md>
    <mrow>R[x] \amp = \{f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n\in R[[x]]\mid a_n=0 \text{ for all } n&gt;  N \text{ for some } N\in \Z_{\geq 0} \} </mrow>
    <mrow> \amp =\{f\in R[[x]]\mid f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^Na_nx^n \text{ for some } N\in \Z_{\geq 0}, a_n\in R\}</mrow>
  </md>.
  It is easy to see that <m>R[x]</m> is a subring of <m>R[[x]]</m>, and thus a ring in its own right. Restricted to <m>R[x]</m>, the power series multiplication rule becomes the familiar polynomial multiplication rule: 
<md number="yes">

     <mrow>c_k\amp =\sum_{j=0}^k a_j b_{k-j}</mrow>
  </md>.
  As illustrated above, when denoting polynomials we will usually drop all the terms with zero coefficients: <eg/>,  <m>f(x)=a_0+a_1x+\cdots +a_nx^n</m>, or <m>f(x)=\anpoly</m>.
</p>

<p>
  Given a nonzero polynomial <m>f\in R[x]</m>, we define its <term>degree</term>, <m>\deg f</m>, to be the largest <m>n</m> satisfying <m>a_n\ne 0</m>.
  If <m>f = 0</m>, we define <m>\deg f=-\infty</m>.
</p>

<p>
  If <m>f(x)=\anpoly</m> is a polynomial of degree <m>n\ne -\infty</m>, we call <m>a_{n}</m> the <term>leading coefficient</term> of <m>f</m>.
  A polynomial with leading coefficient equal to <m>1\in R</m> is called <term>monic</term>.

    <title>Polynomial and power series rings</title>

    When working with a power series ring <m>R[[x]]</m>, we will identify the ring <m>R</m> with power series of the form

    Since this identification preserves the ring operations of <m>R</m>, we end up with a chain of subring inclusions
