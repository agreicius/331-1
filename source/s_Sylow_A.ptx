    Let <m>n</m> be nonzero integer, and let <m>p</m> be a prime integer. The <term><m>p</m>-adic valuation</term> of <m>n</m>, denoted <m>v_p(n)</m>, is the largest integer <m>k</m> such that <m>p^k\mid n</m>.

        <p>
            It follows from the fundamental theorem of arithmetic that the <m>p</m>-adic valuation of an integer <m>n</m> can be read directly from the prime factorization of <m>n</m>. For example, from $12=2^2\cdot 3$ we conclude

    <statement>
    <p>
    Let <m>G</m> be a finite group of cardinality <m>n</m>. Let <m>p</m> be a prime divisor of <m>n</m>, and let <m>v_p(n)=k</m>. A <term><m>p</m>-Sylow subgroup</term> of <m>G</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> of cardinality <m>p^k</m>. We denote the set of all <m>p</m>-Sylow subgroups <m>\Syl_p(G)</m>: <ie/>, 
    <me>
        \Syl_p(G)=\{H\leq G\mid \abs{H}=p^{k}\}
    </me>.
    Lastly we let <m>n_p(G)</m> be the number of <m>p</m>-Sylow subgroups of <m>G</m>:

        Let's illustrate the definitions above with some groups whose lattices of subgroups we know a great deal about already.

        <mrow>\Syl_3(S_3) \amp = \{\angvec{(123)}\}</mrow>

    <p>
    Let <m>G=\angvec{g}</m> be a finite cyclic group of cardinality <m>n=\ord g</m>. Fix a prime divisor <m>p</m> of <m>n</m>, and let <m>v_p(n)=k</m>, so that <m>n=p^km</m>, where <m>p\nmid m</m>. From <xref ref="th_cyclic_subgroup_fin"/>, we know there is exactly one subgroup of <m>G</m> of cardinality <m>p^k</m>: namely, <m>H=\angvec{g^{n/p^k}}=\angvec{g^m}</m>. Thus

    <p>
    We have <m>\abs{S_4}=24=2^3\cdot 3</m>. We have not computed the full lattice of subgroups of <m>S_4</m> yet, so we are not quite in a position to say immediately what the various Sylow subgroups of <m>S_4</m> are.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, since a 3-Sylow subgroup is just a group of cardinality 3 in this case, it must be a cyclic subgroup generated by a 3-cycle. Thus, we have 
    <md>
        <mrow>\Syl_3(S_4) \amp = \{\angvec{(123)}, \angvec{(124)}, \angvec{134}, \angvec{(234)}\}</mrow>

    just as in <xref ref="eg_Sylow_A4"/>.
    </p> 
    <p>
    What about the <m>2</m>-Sylow subgroups?  Recall that you showed in a homework exercise that there are exactly three subgroups of <m>S_4</m> that are isomorphic to <m>D_4</m>: call them <m>K_1, K_2, K_3</m>. (In fact, each <m>K_i</m> can be described as <m>\angvec{(abcd),(ac)}</m>.) Thus we have 
    <me>
        \Syl_2(S_4)\supseteq \{K_1,K_2,K_3\}
    </me>.
    It turns out that this inclusion is in fact an equality, as we will be able to show using Sylow 2.

    <p>
        Before stating the three Sylow subgroups, we make official the notion of a <m>p</m>-group.

        The statements of <xref ref="th_Sylow_1" text="title"/> and <xref ref="th_Sylow_3" text="title"/> are easily verified in examples <xref first="eg_Sylow_S3" last="eg_Sylow_A4" text="global"/>. Using <xref ref="th_Sylow_2" text="title"/>, we can now verify that our description of the <m>2</m>-Sylow subgroups of <m>S_4</m> in <xref ref="eg_Sylow_S4"/> is complete. Why? We know that <m>S_4</m> has exactly three subgroups isomorphic to <m>D_4</m>. Since their cardinality is <m>8</m>, these are <m>2</m>-Sylow subgroups. Are there any others? No! By <xref ref="th_Sylow_2" text="title"/> all <m>2</m>-Sylow subgroups of <m>S_4</m> are conjugate. Since conjugation defines an isomorphism, it follows that all <m>2</m>-Sylow subgroups of <m>S_4</m> are isomorphic to <m>D_4</m>. Thus the three we provided are the only ones. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In a similar vein, <xref ref="th_Sylow_2" text="title"/> tells us that all of the <m>3</m>-Sylow subgroups of <m>A_4</m> are conjugate. This is not immediately obvious, especially since the 3-cycles of <m>A_4</m> break up into two distinct conjugacy classes:

    <subsection xml:id="ss_Sylow_action_subsets">
    <title>First action: <m>G</m> on <m>p^k</m>-subsets of <m>G</m></title>
    
    
    <p>
        Our proof of the Sylow theorems proceeds as a sequence of three well-chosen group actions, each of whose decomposition into orbits yields useful information. For the first action, we have <m>G</m> acting on the set <m>A</m> of all subsets of <m>G</m> of cardinality <m>p^k</m>, where <m>v_p(\abs{G})=k</m>: <ie/>, 
        <me>
            A=\{X\subseteq G\mid \abs{X}=p^k\}
        </me>,
        the set of all <term><m>p^k</m>-subsets</term> of <m>G</m>. The action here is by left multiplication:  <ie/>, given <m>X=\{g_1,g_2,\dots, g_{p^k}\}</m> and <m>g\in G</m>, we define 
                            <me>
                                g\cdot X=\{gg_1,gg_2,\dots, gg_{p^k}\}
                            </me>.
    A detailed analysis of this action is given in <xref ref="prop_G_acts_psets"/>. This reveals that the <m>p</m>-Sylow subgroups of <m>G</m> are in 1-1 correspondence with the orbits of this action that are generated by an actual subgroup. Before getting into the details of that proof, it pays to look at a concrete example.

    <title>Action of <m>D_3</m> on <m>2</m>-subsets</title>
    <statement>
    <p>
        Let <m>G=D_3</m>, and let <m>A</m> be the set of all <m>2</m>-subsets of <m>D_3</m>. The action of <m>G</m> on <m>A</m> gives rise to the following orbits:

        </md>.
        Note that the three <m>2</m>-Sylow subgroups of <m>D_3</m> are contained in the three distinct orbits of size <m>6/2=3</m>, and that the one orbit whose cardinality is greater than <m>2</m> includes no <m>2</m>-Sylow subgroups.

                        It suffices to prove that any orbit <m>O_X\subseteq A</m> contains a subset <m>X'</m> that contains <m>e</m>. This is easy, 
                        if <m>X=\{g_1,g_2,\dots, g_{p^k}\}</m>, then

                        With <m>X_i</m> as above, we have <m>G_{X_i}\subseteq X_i</m>. This is because if <m>g\in G_{X_i}</m>, then since <m>e\in X_i</m> and <m>g\cdot X_i=X_i</m>, we must have <m>g=ge\in X_i</m>. As a result, we have

                            \abs{G_{X_i}}\leq \abs{X_i}=p^k

                        It follows that

                         For the second statement notes that since <m>\abs{O_{X_i}}</m> is a divisor of <m>n=p^km</m>, it must be of the form <m>p^im</m> or <m>p^i d</m> for some <m>d\mid m</m> with <m>1\leq  d&lt; m</m>.

                    <p>
                         Since <m>\abs{O_{X_i}}\mid n=p^km</m> and <m>\abs{O_{X_i}}\geq m</m>, it follows that  <m>\abs{O_{X_i}}=p^{n_i}m</m> for some <m>0\leq n_i\leq k</m>.We have <m>\abs{O_{X_i}}=m</m> if and only if <m>\abs{G_{X_i}}=p^k</m> if and only if <m>G_{X_i}=X_i</m>, since <m>G_{X_i}\subseteq X_i</m> and <m>\abs{G_{X_i}}=\abs{X_i}=p^k</m>. In this case <m>X_i=G_{X_i}=H_i</m> is a <m>p</m>-Sylow subgroup of <m>G</m>, and by definition of the group action, the orbit <m>O_{H_i}</m> is literally the coset space <m>G/H_i</m>.

                        where <m>n_i\geq 1</m> for all <m>s+1\leq i\leq r</m>. The last line follows since there are exactly <m>n_p(G)</m> orbits of cardinality <m>m</m>, and since all other orbits have cardinality <m>p^jm</m> for some <m>j\geq 1</m>. As a result, we have 
                        <md>
                            <mrow>{n\choose p^k} \amp \equiv m\cdot n_p(G)</mrow>
                        </md>.
                        Now for a wonderful trick. Since the equivalence above holds for <em>any</em> group of cardinality <m>n</m>, in particular it holds for a cyclic group. But in this special case we have <m>n_p(G)=1</m>. It follows that 
                        <me>
                            {n\choose p^k}\equiv m \pmod p
                        </me>. 
                        Lastly, since <m>\gcd(m,p)=1</m>, it is invertible modulo <m>p</m>, allowing us to conclude that 
                        <me>
                            1\equiv n_p(G) \pmod p
                        </me>,
                        as desired.

        Note that <xref ref="prop_G_acts_psets"/> includes the formula <xref ref="eq_Sylow_3_modp"/> among its results, giving us a partial proof of <xref ref="th_Sylow_3" text="title"/>. Additionally, formula <xref ref="eq_Sylow_3_modp"/> implies <xref ref="th_Sylow_1" text="title"/>, as we me now make official.

                Let <m>G</m> be a finite group of cardinality <m>n</m>, and let <m>p</m> be a prime divisor of <m>n</m>. We have

        <proof>
            <p>
                Since <m>n_p(G)\equiv 1\pmod p</m> and <m>0\not\equiv 1\pmod p</m>, it follows that <m>n_p(G)\ne 0</m>. Equivalently, <m>\Syl_p(G)\ne \emptyset</m>.

        Before leaving this first group action in our suite of group actions, we extract from the proof of <xref ref="prop_G_acts_psets"/> a wonderful gem of a combinatorial fact.
