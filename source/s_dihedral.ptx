  <description>the dihedral group of cardinality <m>2n</m></description>
</notation>
<statement>
<p>
Fix an integer <m>n\geq 3</m>. Let <m>P_n\subseteq \R^2</m> be the regular <m>n</m>-gon centered at the origin with one vertex at <m>(1,0)</m>. We define <m>D_n</m> to be the set of rigid motions of <m>\R^2</m> that map <m>P_n</m> onto itself: <ie/>,
<me>
    D_n=\{f\in \Isom(\R^2)\mid f(D_n)=D_n\}
</me>.
Function composition defines a binary operation 
<md>
    <mrow>\circ \colon D_{n}\times D_n \amp \rightarrow D_n</mrow>
    <mrow>(f,g) \amp \mapsto f\circ g</mrow>
</md>.
The pair <m>(D_n, \circ)</m> is a group, called the <term>dihedral group of cardinality <m>2n</m></term>.
</p>
<p>
    The group identity of <m>D_n</m> is the identity function <m>\id\colon \R^2\rightarrow \R^2</m>. Given an element <m>f\in D_n</m>, its group inverse is its function inverse <m>f^{-1}</m>.

    <title><m>D_n</m> or <m>D_{2n}</m></title>
    <p>
        What we call <m>D_{n}</m> the book calls <m>D_{2n}</m>! This is somewhat unfortunate, but it turns out there is no real consensus in the mathematical community as to which is the preferred notation. As we see below, the <m>2n</m> subscript has the advantage of indicating the cardinality of the group in question. On the other hand, the <m>n</m> subscript reminds us that the group is defined in terms of isometries that fix an <m>n</m>-gon. The latter is consistent with our notation for permutation groups <m>S_n</m> (to be introduced soon), which are defined as the group of permutations acting on a set of <m>n</m> elements. That fact, along with the fact that I was simply raised on <m>D_n</m> and not <m>D_{2n}</m> has persuaded me to part ways with the text in this case.

<title>Dihedral group</title>
<statement>
<p>
Fix an integer <m>n\geq 3</m>, let <m>P_n</m> be the regular <m>n</m>-gon centered at the origin with one vertex at <m>(1,0)</m>, and let <m>D_n</m> be the corresponding dihedral group.  
</p>
 <p>
Furthermore, define <m>r\colon \R^2\rightarrow \R^2</m> to be rotation by <m>2\pi/n</m> about the origin, and define <m>s\colon \R^2\rightarrow \R^2</m> to be reflection across the <m>x</m>-axis.
