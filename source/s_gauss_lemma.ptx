    <title>Gauss's lemma</title>

    <p>
        Having spent some significant time finding UFDs (and PIDs) within the family of quadratic rings of integers, we now explore how the property of being a UFD fares under the polynomial ring construction. The answer here is a simple and happy one: if <m>R</m> is a UFD, then so is <m>R[x]</m>! In particular, we see that our friend <m>\Z[x]</m> is a UFD, despite its not being a PID. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As you will see below, not only is the answer a simple one, but the proof approach is essentially the first thing that might cross your mind. In more detail, let <m>F=\Frac R</m> be the field of fractions of <m>R</m>. Identifying <m>R</m> with its image under the localization map <m>\lambda\colon R\rightarrow F</m> (which is injective in this case), we think of <m>R[x]</m> as a subring of <m>F[x]</m>. The latter is a PID, and hence a UFD. As such, we might naively hope to proceed as follows: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    given a polynomial <m>f(x)\in R[x]</m>, consider it as an element of <m>F[x]</m>;
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    since <m>F[x]</m> is a UFD, we can factor <m>f</m> into powers of irreducibles as <m>f=\prod_{i=1}^r f_i^{n_i}</m>, and this factorization is unique in some sense;
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    so it stands to reason that <m>f</m> should factor into irreducibles in <m>R[x]</m>, right? 
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        In fact yes, it does stand to reason that <m>f</m> factors similarly over <m>R[x]</m>, but the argument is more delicate than you might expect. There are two key issues that the sketch above willfully steamrolls over: (a) the irreducible elements <m>f_i</m> are elements of <m>F[x]</m>, but not necessarily <m>R[x]</m>; (b) even if we have <m>f_i\in R[x]</m> for all <m>i</m>, being irreducible in <m>F[x]</m> does not <foreign>a priori</foreign> imply irreducibility in <m>R[x]</m>. Indeed, that implication is patently false: <m>f(x)=2x</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m>, but not irreducible in <m>\Z[x]</m>, since <m>f(x)=2\cdot x</m> is a factorization into two nonunits of <m>\Z[x]</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Accordingly, we will need to proceed with some caution in our proof, keeping straight where polynomials live (in <m>R[x]</m> or <m>F[x]</m>), and for a polynomial <m>f\in R[x]</m> we need to distinguish between being reducible/irreducible in <m>R[x]</m> and being reducible/irreducible in <m>F[x]</m>. (As you will see from Gauss's lemma, the two notions are very close to being equivalent, but not quite.) 
    </p>
    <p>
        The notions of a polynomial's <em>content</em> and <em>primitive polynomials</em> turn out to be just the thing we need for finessing these issues.

            Suppose <m>q=a/b</m> is a root of <m>f</m> in <m>F[x]</m>, where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are relatively prime.

Note that <m>(bx-a)</m> is primitive, since <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are relatively prime. By Gauss's lemma, we have 
            <m>f(x)=c(bx-a)g_0(x)</m>, where <m>c\in R</m> and <m>g_0</m> is an associated primitive polynomial of <m>g</m>. Comparing leading terms and constant terms of the the left and right sides of this equation, we see that

            where <m>d_m</m> and <m>d_0</m> are the leading and constant terms of <m>g_0</m>, respectively. Since <m>c\in R</m>, we conclude that <m>b\mid a_n</m> and <m>a\mid d_0</m>, as claimed.
