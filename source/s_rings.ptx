    <title>Rings</title>
<p>
    In a sense the motivation for the mathematical definition of a ring in mathematics is more immediate than that for a group. From very early on in our mathematical training we are introduced to quite a rich variety of different <em>number systems</em> including the integers <m>\Z</m>, the rational numbers <m>\Q</m>, the real numbers <m>\R</m>, and the complex numbers <m>\C</m>. Roughly understood, a number system is a set together with two distinct operations, addition and multiplication, which are each reasonably well-behaved and moreover play nicely together. <xref ref="d_ring"/> makes precise exactly what me mean by this.

<title>Ring</title>
<statement>
<p>
A <term>ring</term> is a triple <m>(R,+,\cdot)</m>, where <m>R</m> is a nonempty set, and <m>+</m> and <m>\cdot</m> are binary operations 
<md>
    <mrow>R\times R \amp \xrightarrow{\phantom{XX}+\phantom{XX}} R \amp R\times R\amp \xrightarrow{\phantom{XX}\bullet\phantom{XX}} R</mrow>
</md>,
called <term>ring addition</term> and <term>ring multiplication</term>, respectively, that satisfy the following axioms. 
<ol marker="(i)">
    <li>
        <p>
            <m>(R,+)</m> is an abelian group. 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
          Ring multiplication is associative: <ie/>, <m>a\cdot(b\cdot c)=(a\cdot b)\cdot c</m> for all <m>a,b,c\in R</m>.   
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Ring multiplication distributes over ring addition: <ie/>, we have 
            <mdn>
                <mrow>a\cdot (b+c) \amp =a\cdot b+a\cdot c</mrow>
                <mrow>(b+c)\cdot d \amp =b\cdot d+c\cdot d</mrow>
            </mdn>
            for all <m>a,b,c,d\in R</m>. 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            There is a <term>multiplicative identity</term> element <m>1\in R</m> satisfying 
            <md number="yes" xml:id="eq_mult_id">1\cdot a=a\cdot 1=a</md> for all <m>a\in R</m>. 
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
A ring <m>R</m> is <term>commutative</term> if its ring multiplication is commutative and <term>noncommutative</term> otherwise. 
</p>
</statement>
</definition>
<warning>
    <p>
        The Dummit and Foote text does not include (iv) as one of the axioms a ring needs to satisfy.
Instead it distinguishes between rings <em>with</em> and <em>without identity</em>. We will not follow suit and will
conscientiously point out resulting discrepancies between our exposition and the book’s.
    </p>
</warning>
<convention>
    <p>
        Addition in a ring will always be denoted by <m>+</m>, and this notation will never be suppressed. In contrast, we are free to denote the ring multiplication operation in any manner we please, but will more often than not omit the notation in ring expressions. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally we will use the following <em>integer multiple</em> notation: 
        <md>
            <mrow>n a \amp = \underset{n \text{ times}}{\underbrace{a+a+\cdots +a}} \amp a\in R, n\in \Z_{\geq 1}</mrow>
            <mrow>(-n)a \amp = n(-a) \amp a\in R, n\in \Z_{\geq 1}</mrow>
        </md>.
    </p>
</convention>
<p>
    As mentioned at the top, our definition of a ring is chosen to generalize the familiar number systems (<m>\Z</m>, <m>\Q</m>, <m>\R</m>, <m>\C</m>) of our mathematical youth. That these sets are rings (indeed, commutative rings) with respect to their usual arithmetic operations is a result of arithmetic properties you learned long ago. We add to this collection the slightly more exotic modular rings <m>\Z/n\Z</m> for <m>n</m> a positive integer; the ring axiom identities for modular addition and multiplication follow directly from the corresponding identites for the integer operations.
</p>
<activity xml:id="spec_elem_comm_rings">
<title>Elementary commutative rings</title>
<statement>
<p>
The sets <m>\Z</m>, <m>\Q</m>, <m>\R</m>, and <m>\C</m> are all commutative rings with respect to their usual addition and multiplication operations. Additionally, for any positive integer <m>n</m>, the set <m>\Z/n\Z</m> is a commutative ring with respect to its modular addition and multiplication operations. 
</p>
</statement>

<p>
    We need not travel too far to find an examples of noncommutative rings. Matrix arithmetic furnishes us with a familiar enough example. 
</p>
<activity xml:id="spec_matrix_rings">
<title>Matrix rings</title>
<statement>
<p>
Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring. Given a positive integer <m>n</m>, we define <m>M_n(R)</m> to be the set of all <m>n\times n</m> matrices with coefficients in <m>R</m>.  
</p>
<p>
    Given matrices <m>A=[a_{ij}],B=[b_{ij}]\in M_n(R)</m>, we define their sum <m>A+B</m> and product <m>AB</m> as follows: 
    <md>
        <mrow number="yes" xml:id="eq_matrix_add">A+B \amp =[a_{ij}+b_{ij}]</mrow>
        <mrow number="yes" xml:id="eq_matrix_prod">AB \amp = [c_{ij}] \amp c_{ij}=\sum_{k=1}^na_{ik}b_{kj}</mrow>
    </md>.
    The triple <m>(M_n(R), +,\cdot)</m>, where <m>+</m> and <m>\cdot</m> are the matrix addition and multiplication operations defined above, is a ring called the <term>ring of <m>n\times n</m> matrices over <m>R</m></term> (or <term>with coefficients in <m>R</m></term>).
</p>
<p>
    If <m>n\geq 2</m>, then <m>M_n(R)</m> is a noncommutative ring, as an argument very similar to the one in <xref ref="eg_nonabelian_gln"/> shows. 
</p>
</statement>
</activity>
<remark>
<title>Matrix rings</title>
<p>
We can remove the restriction that <m>R</m> be commutative in <xref ref="spec_matrix_rings"/>. In other words, the matrix operations <xref ref="eq_matrix_add"/> satisfy the ring axioms whether or not <m>R</m> is commutative. We will restrict our attention to the case where <m>R</m> is commutative, however, as here the algebraic properties of <m>M_n(R)</m> are somewhat simpler. In particular, when <m>R</m> is commutative, we can define a determinant function <m>\det M_n(R)\rightarrow R</m> in the usual fashion, and <m>\det</m> enjoys essentially all of the properties you are familiar with in the case where <m>R=\R</m>. 
</p>
</remark>
<p>
    We now dispense with the usual <q>general properties</q> result for our newly defined mathematical friends.

    Our matrix ring example is in fact an example of a <em>ring construction</em>: a method of building new rings from existing ones. The <em>product ring</em> construction is another such example.

<activity xml:id="spec_ring_product">
<title>Product rings</title>
<statement>
<p>
Let <m>I</m> be a nonempty set, and let <m>(R_i)_{i\in I}</m> be a family of rings indexed by <m>I</m>. We define an addition and multiplication operation on <m>R=\prod_{i\in I}R_i</m> as follows:
<md>
    <mrow number="yes" xml:id="eq_product_ring_ops">R\times R \amp \xrightarrow{\phantom{XX}+\phantom{XX}} R 
        \amp R\times R\amp \xrightarrow{\phantom{XX}\bullet\phantom{XX}} R 
    </mrow>
    <mrow>(a_i)_{i\in I}, (b_i)_{i\in I} \amp \mapsto (a_i+b_i)_{i\in I}
        \amp (a_i)_{i\in I},(b_i)_{i\in I}\amp\mapsto (a_ib_i)_{i\in I}
    </mrow>
</md>.
In other words, addition and multiplication of tuples is defined component-wise. 
</p>
<p>
The triple <m>(R,+,\cdot)</m> is ring called the <term>product</term> of the rings <m>R_i</m>. Note that we have already seen that <m>(R,+)</m> is a group. (See <xref ref="prop_product_group"/>.) The identity element of <m>R</m> is the tuple <m>1=(1_{R_i})_{i\in I}</m>, where for all <m>i\in I</m>, <m>1_{R_i}</m> is the identity element of <m>R_i</m>.

    Technically speaking, the <em>ring of functions</em> construction introduced next is just a special case of the product ring construction: that is, by <em>definition</em> we have 
    <me>
        \mathcal{F}(X,R)=R^X=\prod_{x\in X}R
    </me>.
    We include it nonetheless, as this construction (in this particular guise) is particular important in analysis contexts.
