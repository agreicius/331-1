                Let <m>R</m> be an integral domain. For all <m>p\in R</m>, if <m>p</m> is prime, then <m>p</m> is irreducible.

    <statement>
    <p>
    Let <m>p</m> be an element of the principal ideal domain <m>R</m>. The following statements are equivalent. 
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                <m>p</m> is prime (equivalently, <m>(p)</m> is a prime ideal).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <m>p</m> is irreducible. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <m>(p)</m> is maximal. 
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
    <p>
        The proof of this result is identical to that of <xref ref="th_max_prime_poly"/>, which treats the special case of polynomial rings over a field. If you look there, you'll notice that the only thing used is the fact that <m>F[x]</m> is a PID when <m>F</m> is a field. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For convenience, however, we reprise some of the proof here in cursory form. Implication (1)<m>\implies</m>(2) is true in any commutative ring, as is (3)<m>\implies</m>(1). For the last link, (2)<m>\implies</m>(3), to show that <m>(p)</m> is maximal if <m>p</m> is irreducible, we use the fact that <m>R</m> is a PID to assert that <m>(p)\subseteq I</m> implies <m>(p)\subseteq (a)</m> for some <m>a\in R</m>. But in that case <m>a\mid p</m>, in which case either <m>a</m> is a unit (and <m>(a)=R</m>), or <m>a</m> is an associate of <m>p</m>, in which case <m>(a)=(p)</m>.

    Let <m>R=\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m>. Show that the elements <m>2</m> and <m>3</m> are irreducible, but not prime. Conclude that <m>R</m> is not a PID (nor a Euclidean domain).

                The factorization <xref ref="eq_factor_irr"/> is unique in the following sense: if we have

                then <m>n=m</m>, and after a reordering there are units <m>u_i\in R^*</m> such that <m>q_i=u_ip_i</m> for all <m>1\leq i\leq n</m>. In other words, in any factorization of <m>a</m> into irreducibles, the number of irreducible factors is constant, and the irreducible elements appearing in the factorization are unique up to multiplication by a unit.

    <statement>

    Let <m>p</m> be an element of the unique factorization domain <m>R</m>. The following statements are equivalent. 
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                <m>p</m> is prime (equivalently, <m>(p)</m> is a prime ideal).

    <proof>
    <p>
        Since (1)<m>\implies</m>(2)  is true in any commutative ring, it suffices to show  (2)<m>\implies</m>(1).

    <p>
        Assume <m>p</m> is irreducible, and that <m>p\mid ab</m> for some elements <m>a,b\in R</m>. This means we have

        is an irreducible factorization of <m>ab</m>. This shows that <m>p</m> is (up to multiplication by a unit) one of the irreducible elements appearing in the factorization of <m>ab</m>. Similarly, since we can
