    <title>Subgroup lattice</title>
    <p>
        A deep understanding of a group <m>G</m> will include an understanding of its subgroup structure. In more detail we want to know (a) what the set <m>\mathcal{S}</m> of <em>all</em> subgroups of <m>G</m> is, and (b) for all <m>H_1, H_2\in \mathcal{S}</m>, we want to know whether <m>H_1\leq H_2</m>, <m>H_2\leq H_1</m>, or neither. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Using slightly fancier language, the pair <m>(\mathcal{S}, \leq)</m> of all subsgroups of <m>G</m> partially ordered by the set inclusion relation <m>\leq</m> (which recall is just <m>\subseteq</m> for subgroups) is what is called a <em>partially ordered set</em>, or <em>lattice</em>. We wish to understand the precise structure of this lattice.

    <proposition xml:id="prop_intersection_subgroups">
        <title>Intersection of subgroups</title>        
        <statement>
            <p>
                Let <m>G</m> be a group, and let <m>(H_i)_{i\in I}</m> be a family of subgroups <m>H_i\leq G</m> indexed by the nonempty set <m>I</m>. The intersection <m>H=\bigcap_{i\in I}H_i</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>. In plain English, the intersection of a family of subgroups is again a subgroup. 
            </p>
        </statement>
        <proof>
            <p>
                Note that the indexing set <m>I</m> is arbitrary here: it need not be finite, or even countable. This does not complicate our proof in anyway: in the end, this is an exercise in dealinging with the quantifier <q>for all</q> that defines the intersection. Let's show that the three axioms of <xref ref="d_subgroup"/> are satisfied.
