    <title>Case study: polynomial rings</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
        The integers furnish us with a nice example where we can completely analyze a rings ideal structure, including its prime and maximal ideals, as well as its quotients. In this section we will look at another case study: polynomial rings <m>F[x]</m>, where <m>F</m> is a field. As you will see, the ideal structure of <m>F[x]</m> has many similarities with that of the integers. We will see later that these similarities are the result of a deeper similarity between the two rings: namely, that both are examples of <em>Euclidean domains</em>. Our discussion will also include concrete descriptions of the quotients of polynomial rings <m>F[x]</m>, which in turn provide us with many new examples of rings to work. In particular, the construction of fields as quotients <m>F[x]/M</m> where <m>M</m> is a maximal ideal will play an important role in our development of field theory in Math 331-3.

    <title>Division algorithm for polynomials</title>
    <p>
        Although we will mainly be interested in polynomial rings over fields, we begin with a useful result that applies to general polynomial rings. 
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="th_div_alg_poly">
    <title>Division algorithm for polynomials</title>
    <statement>
    <p>
     Let <m>R</m> be a nontrivial commutative ring, and let <m>f\in R[x]</m> be a nonzero polynomial whose leading coefficient is a unit: <ie/>, we have <m>f(x)=\anpoly</m>, where <m>a_n\in R^*</m>. Given a polynomial <m>g\in R[x]</m>, there is a unique pair of polynomials <m>(q,r)\in R[x]\times R[x]</m> satisfying the following properties. 
     <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                <m>g=qf+r</m>.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <m>\deg r&lt; \deg f</m>.
            </p>
        </li>
     </ol>
    </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
    <p>
        We need to prove two things: that given any <m>g</m> there are polynomials <m>q,r</m> satisfying properties (i) and (ii), and furthermore that the pair <m>(q,r)</m> is unique. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We begin with existence. Let <m>X</m> be the set of all pairs of polynomials <m>(q',r')</m> satisfying condition (i) (but not necessarily (ii)). We will show that there is a pair <m>(q,r)\in X</m> that also satisfies (ii).  Observe that <m>X</m> is nonempty, since in particular it contains the pair <m>(0,g)</m>. If <m>(q,0)\in X</m>, then this pair satisfies (ii) since <m>\deg 0=-\infty&lt; \deg f</m> (<m>f</m> being a nonzero polynomial). Otherwise, let <m>(q,r)</m> be an element of <m>X</m> for which <m>r</m> has minimal finite degree. (Such a pair exists since the set <m>\{\deg r'\mid (q',r')\in X\}</m> is a nonempty subset of <m>\Z_{\geq 0}</m>, and hence has a minimal element.) We claim that <m>\deg r&lt; \deg f</m>, and hence that <m>(q,r)</m> satisfies (ii). Suppose, by contradiction, that <m>r(x)=\bmpoly</m> with <m>\deg r=m\geq \deg f=n</m>. Since the leading term <m>a_n</m> of <m>f</m> is a unit, we can write 
        <md>
            <mrow>r(x) \amp b_ma_n^{-1}x^{m-n}f(x)+r(x)-b_ma_n^{-1}x^{m-n}f(x)</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp =h(x)f(x)+s(x)</mrow>
        </md>,
        where <m>h(x)=b_ma_n^{-1}x^{m-n}</m>, and where
        <md>
            <mrow>s(x) \amp =r(x)-b_ma_n^{-1}x^{m-n}f(x)</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = r(x)-b_ma_n^{-1}x^{m-n}(\anpoly)</mrow>
            <mrow>     \amp =(b_m-b_m)x^{m}+(b_{m-1}-b_ma_n^{-1}a_{n-1})x^{m-1}+\cdots</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp =(b_{m-1}-b_ma_{n}^{-1}a_{n-1})x^{n-1}+\cdots</mrow>
        </md>
        has degree at most <m>m-1</m>. But then we have 
        <md>
            <mrow>g\amp =qf+r </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = qf+hf+s</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = (q+h)f+s</mrow>
        </md>,
        showing that <m>(q+h,s)\in X</m> and <m>\deg s&lt; \deg r</m>. This contradicts the minimality of <m>\deg r</m>. Thus <m>\deg r&lt; \deg f</m>, and we are done. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We now prove that there is exactly one pair <m>(q,r)</m> satisfying (i) and (ii). Indeed, suppose <m>(q,r)</m> and <m>(q',r')</m> both satisfy these properties. From <m>g=qf+r=q'f+r'</m>, it follows that 
        <md>
            <mrow>(q-q')f \amp =(r'-r)</mrow>
        </md>.
        If <m>q-q'\ne 0</m>, then since the leading coefficient of <m>f</m> is a unit, it is easy to see that <m>\deg (q-q')f\geq \deg f</m>. But then we would have 
        <md>
            <mrow>\deg r'-r \amp =\deg (q-q')f \geq \deg f</mrow>
        </md>,
        a contradiction since <m>\deg (r-r')\leq \max\{\deg r,\deg r'\}&lt; \deg f</m>. Thus <m>q-q'=0</m>, from which it follows that <m>r'-r=0</m>. We conclude that <m>q=q'</m> and <m>r=r'</m>, and thus that <m>(q,r)=(q',r')</m>, as desired. 
    </p>
    </proof>

                            The restriction <m>\pi\vert_R\colon R\rightarrow R[x]/(f)</m> is injective. Thus we can identify <m>\pi(R)</m> with <m>R</m>, and we will write <m>\pi(r)=\overline{r}=r</m> for all <m>r\in R</m>.

            Note that <m>R[x]/(f)</m> is an <m>R</m>-algebra, with structural ring homomorphism given by the composition

            Once we have the language of modules at our disposal, we will be able to summarize (2) of <xref ref="th_quot_poly"/> by saying that <m>R[x]/(f)</m> is an <m>R</m>-algebra that is free of rank <m>\deg f</m> as an <m>R</m>-module.

        <p>
            For now we content ourselves with a special case of this observation. Namely, when <m>F</m> is a field, then <m>F[x]/(f)</m> is an <m>F</m>-algebra and hence an <m>F</m>-vector space. In this context, (2) of <xref ref="th_quot_poly"/> tells us that

    The integers <m>\Z</m> are the quintessential example of a PID that is not a field. As we now show with the help of the <xref ref="th_div_alg_poly"/>, polynomial rings over fields furnish us with another interesting example. The proof is very similar to the one we gave for <xref ref="th_cyclic_subgroup_inf"/>.
   </p>
    
    <theorem xml:id="th_poly_ring_field">
    <title>Polynomial ring over a field</title>
    <statement>
    <p>
    If <m>F</m> is a field, then <m>F[x]</m> is a principal ideal domain. In more detail, for every nonzero proper ideal <m>I</m>, there is a unique monic polynomial <m>f\in F[x]</m> such that <m>I=(f)</m>. 
    </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
    <p>
        First note that <m>F[x]</m> is an integral domain since <m>F</m> is an integral domain, as we have seen previously.
    </p>
    <p>
        As always we have <m>\{0\}=(0)</m> and <m>F[x]=(1)</m>. Let <m>I</m> be a proper nonzero ideal.  Since <m>I\ne F[x]</m>, it contains no elements of <m>(F[x])^*=F^*</m>. It follows that the set 
        <md>
            <mrow>\deg(I-\{0\}) \amp =\{\deg f\mid f\in I\}</mrow>
        </md> 
        is a nonzero subset of <m>\Z_{\geq 1}</m>, and thus has a minimal element <m>n\geq 1</m>. Let <m>f</m> be an element of <m>I</m> with <m>\deg f=n</m>. Since <m>cf\in I</m> for all <m>c\in F</m>, we may assume without loss of generality that <m>f</m> is monic. We will show that <m>(f)=I</m>. It is clear that <m>(f)\subseteq I</m>. For the other direction,  given any <m>g\in I</m>, we may write 
        <md>
            <mrow>g \amp =qf+r</mrow>
        </md>,
        where <m>\deg r\leq \deg f</m>. Since <m>r=g-qf\in I</m>, and since <m>f</m> has minimal degree among elements of <m>I-\{0\}</m>, we see that <m>r=0</m>, and <m>g=qf\in (f)</m>. This proves that <m>I\subseteq (f)</m> and hence that <m>I=(f)</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We now show that the monic polynomial <m>f</m> with <m>I=(f)</m> is unique. Suppose we have <m>(f)=(g)</m> where <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are monic. It follows that <m>f\mid g</m> and <m>g\mid f</m>, or equivalently <m>g=pf</m> and <m>f=qg</m> for polynomials <m>p,q\in F[x]</m>. From <xref ref="prop_deg_poly"/>, we conclude that

        It follows that <m>\deg f=\deg g</m>, and hence that <m>g=c f</m> for some constant <m>c\in F^*</m>. Since <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are both monic, we conclude that <m>c=1</m> and <m>f=g</m>.

As a result, it follows that a polynomial <m>f</m> has a linear factor if and only if we have <m>f(c)=0</m> for some <m>c\in F</m>: <ie/>, if and only if <m>f</m> has a root in <m>F</m>. We conclude that a degree-2 polynomial is irreducible if and only if it has no roots in <m>F</m>.

            <title>Degree 3</title>
            <p>
                Again, looking at degrees, we see that if <m>f\in F[x]</m> is a degree-3 polynomial, then <m>f</m> has a nontrivial factorization <m>f=gh</m> if and only if one of the factors is linear. Thus, just as in the degree-2 case, we conclude that a degree-3 polynomial <m>f</m> is irreducible if and only if it has no roots in <m>F</m>.

    Things become more complicated once our polynomials have degree 4 or higher: in particular, being irreducible is no longer equivalent to having no roots. For example, the polynomial <m>f(x)=(x^2+1)(x^2+2)\in \R[x]</m> is easily seen to have no roots in <m>\R</m>, and yet is manifestly reducible.

    From the quadratic formula theorem, we see easily that the polynomials <m>x^2+1</m> and <m>x^2+x+1</m> have no roots in <m>\R</m>. It follows from <xref ref="rem_irr_poly"/> that both polynomials are irreducible in <m>\R[x]</m>, and hence that the corresponding quotients are fields.

Furthermore, clearly, <m>(x^2+1)\subseteq \ker \phi</m>, since <m>(i)^2+1=-1+1=0</m>; and since <m>(x^2+1)</m> is maximal (<m>x^2+1</m> is irreducible), it follows that <m>(x^2+1)=\ker\phi</m>. The claim follows from the first isomorphism theorem.

We claim that <m>\im\phi=\C</m>. This is not as obvious as in the previous case.

    <title>Field of cardinality 25</title>

    Construct an explicit field of cardinality <m>25</m>
    </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
    <p>
    Consider the polynomial ring <m>\F_5[x]</m>. Any quotient of the form <m>R=\F_5[x]/(x^2+ax+b)</m> is an <m>\F_5</m>-algebra that is of dimension 2 as an <m>\F_5</m>-vector space. As a result, any such ring <m>R</m> satisfies <m>\abs{R}=5^2=25</m>. To produce a field, we simply must pick an irreducible quadratic polynomial <m>f(x)=x^2+ax+b</m>; and according to <xref ref="rem_irr_poly"/>, this is equivalent to picking <m>f</m> so that it has no roots in <m>\F_5</m>. Since <m>\F_5</m> only has 5 elements, it is easy to verify whether a given polynomial has a root in <m>\F_5</m> or not. Consider <m>f(x)=x^2+1</m>, for example. We simply need to compute a table of values 
    <md number="yes">
        <mrow>f(0) \amp = 1 \amp f(1)\amp = 2 \amp f(2) \amp =5 =0</mrow>
        <mrow>f(3) \amp = 0 \amp f(4)\amp =2</mrow>
    </md>
    to see that <m>f</m> has two roots in <m>\F_5</m> (<m>x=2</m> and <m>x=3</m>), which corresponds to the factorization <m>x^2+1=(x-2)(x-3)</m> in <m>\F_5[x]</m>. Thus <m>x^2+1</m> is not irreducible, and the corresponding quotient <m>\F_5[x]/(x^2+1)</m> is not a field. Indeed, from the factorization we see that <m>\alpha=\overline{x}-2</m> and <m>\beta=\overline{x}-3</m> are nonzero elements of <m>\F_5[x]/(x^2+1)</m> satisfying <m>\alpha\beta=0</m>. Thus <m>\F_5[x]/(x^2+1)</m> is not even an integral domain! (We will see in the next section that <m>\F_5[x]/(x^2+1)\cong \F_5\times \F_5</m>.) 
    </p>
    <p>
        Similar computations show that <m>f(x)=x^2+2</m> has no roots in <m>\F_5</m> and hence is irreducible. Thus <m>F=\F_5[x]/(x^2+2)</m> is a field of cardinality <m>25</m>. Concretetely, since <m>\overline{x}^2=-2=3</m> in <m>F</m>, we have 
        <md>
            <mrow>(a+b\overline{x})(c+d\overline{x}) \amp = ac+3bd+(ad+bc)\overline{x}</mrow>
        </md> 
        for all <m>a,b,c,d\in \F_5</m>. From this formula, it is easy to see that any nonzero element <m>\alpha=a+b\overline{x}\in F</m> has inverse 
        <md>
            <mrow>\alpha^{-1} \amp = (a^2+3b^2)^{-1}(a-b\overline{x})</mrow>
        </md>.

    <title>Finite fields</title>

    It turns out that there are exactly <m>\frac{5^2-5}{2}=10</m> irreducible polynomials of the form <m>f(x)=x^2+ax+b</m> in <m>\F_5[x]</m>. Each of the corresponding quotients <m>\F_5[x]/(f)</m> is thus a field of cardinality <m>25</m>. Miraculously, these fields are all isomorphic! In fact, as we will prove in the next quarter, given any prime power <m>p^n</m> there is exactly one field (up to isomorphism) of cardinality <m>p^n</m>.
