    <title>Case study: polynomial rings</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
        The integers furnish us with a nice example where we can completely analyze a rings ideal structure, including its prime and maximal ideals, as well as its quotients. In this section we will look at another case study: polynomial rings <m>F[x]</m>, where <m>F</m> is a field. As you will see, the ideal structure of <m>F[x]</m> has many similarities with that of the integers. We will see later that these similarities are the result of a deeper similarity between the two rings: namely, that both are examples of <em>Euclidean domains</em>. Our discussion will also include concrete descriptions of the quotients of polynomial rings <m>F[x]</m>, which in turn provide us with many new examples of rings to work. In particular, the construction of fields as quotients <m>F[x]/M</m> where <m>M</m> is a maximal ideal will play an important role in our development of field theory in Math 331-3.

    <title>Division algorithm for polynomials</title>

        Although we will mainly be interested in polynomial rings over fields, we begin with a useful result that applies to general polynomial rings. 
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="th_div_alg_poly">
    <title>Division algorithm for polynomials</title>
    <statement>
    <p>
     Let <m>R</m> be a nontrivial commutative ring, and let <m>f\in R[x]</m> be a nonzero polynomial whose leading coefficient is a unit: <ie/>, we have <m>f(x)=\anpoly</m>, where <m>a_n\in R^*</m>. Given a polynomial <m>g\in R[x]</m>, there is a unique pair of polynomials <m>(q,r)\in R[x]\times R[x]</m> satisfying the following properties. 
     <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                <m>g=qf+r</m>.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <m>\deg r&lt; \deg f</m>.
            </p>
        </li>
     </ol>
    </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
    <p>
        We need to prove two things: that given any <m>g</m> there are polynomials <m>q,r</m> satisfying properties (i) and (ii), and furthermore that the pair <m>(q,r)</m> is unique. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We begin with existence. Let <m>X</m> be the set of all pairs of polynomials <m>(q',r')</m> satisfying condition (i) (but not necessarily (ii)). We will show that there is a pair <m>(q,r)\in X</m> that also satisfies (ii).  Observe that <m>X</m> is nonempty, since in particular it contains the pair <m>(0,g)</m>. If <m>(q,0)\in X</m>, then this pair satisfies (ii) since <m>\deg 0=-\infty&lt; \deg f</m> (<m>f</m> being a nonzero polynomial). Otherwise, let <m>(q,r)</m> be an element of <m>X</m> for which <m>r</m> has minimal finite degree. (Such a pair exists since the set <m>\{\deg r'\mid (q',r')\in X\}</m> is a nonempty subset of <m>\Z_{\geq 0}</m>, and hence has a minimal element.) We claim that <m>\deg r&lt; \deg f</m>, and hence that <m>(q,r)</m> satisfies (ii). Suppose, by contradiction, that <m>r(x)=\bmpoly</m> with <m>\deg r=m\geq \deg f=n</m>. Since the leading term <m>a_n</m> of <m>f</m> is a unit, we can write 
        <md>
            <mrow>r(x) \amp b_ma_n^{-1}x^{m-n}f(x)+r(x)-b_ma_n^{-1}x^{m-n}f(x)</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp =h(x)f(x)+s(x)</mrow>
        </md>,
        where <m>h(x)=b_ma_n^{-1}x^{m-n}</m>, and where
        <md>
            <mrow>s(x) \amp =r(x)-b_ma_n^{-1}x^{m-n}f(x)</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = r(x)-b_ma_n^{-1}x^{m-n}(\anpoly)</mrow>
            <mrow>     \amp =(b_m-b_m)x^{m}+(b_{m-1}-b_ma_n^{-1}a_{n-1})x^{m-1}+\cdots</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp =(b_{m-1}-b_ma_{n}^{-1}a_{n-1})x^{n-1}+\cdots</mrow>
        </md>
        has degree at most <m>m-1</m>. But then we have 
        <md>
            <mrow>g\amp =qf+r </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = qf+hf+s</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = (q+h)f+s</mrow>
        </md>,
        showing that <m>(q+h,s)\in X</m> and <m>\deg s&lt; \deg r</m>. This contradicts the minimality of <m>\deg r</m>. Thus <m>\deg r&lt; \deg f</m>, and we are done. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We now prove that there is exactly one pair <m>(q,r)</m> satisfying (i) and (ii). Indeed, suppose <m>(q,r)</m> and <m>(q',r')</m> both satisfy these properties. From <m>g=qf+r=q'f+r'</m>, it follows that 
        <md>
            <mrow>(q-q')f \amp =(r'-r)</mrow>
        </md>.
        If <m>q-q'\ne 0</m>, then since the leading coefficient of <m>f</m> is a unit, it is easy to see that <m>\deg (q-q')f\geq \deg f</m>. But then we would have 
        <md>
            <mrow>\deg r'-r \amp =\deg (q-q')f \geq \deg f</mrow>
        </md>,
        a contradiction since <m>\deg (r-r')\leq \max\{\deg r,\deg r'\}&lt; \deg f</m>. Thus <m>q-q'=0</m>, from which it follows that <m>r'-r=0</m>. We conclude that <m>q=q'</m> and <m>r=r'</m>, and thus that <m>(q,r)=(q',r')</m>, as desired.

    <title>Polynomial division with remainder</title>
    <statement>
    <p>
    Let <m>R</m> be a nontrivial commutative ring, and let <m>f\in R[x]</m> be a nonzero polynomial whose leading coefficient is a unit. Given a polynomial <m>g\in R[x]</m> we call the unique polynomials <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> satisfying the two conditions of <xref ref="th_div_alg_poly"/> the <term>quotient</term> and <term>remainder</term> upon division of <m>g</m> by <m>f</m>.

        The following result is a corollary of the division algorithm theorem, but is important enough to be deemed a theorem.

    <theorem xml:id="th_quot_poly">
        <title>Quotients of polynomial rings</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Let <m>R</m> be a nontrivial commutative ring, and let <m>f\in R</m> be a polynomial of degree <m>n&gt; 1</m> whose leading coefficient is a unit in <m>R</m>. Additionally, let <m>\pi\colon R[x]\rightarrow R[x]/(f)</m> and write <m>\pi(g)=\overline{g}</m> for all <m>g\in R[x]</m>, so that in particular we have  
                <md>

                            The restriction <m>\pi\vert_R\colon R\rightarrow R[x]/(f)</m> is injective. Thus we can identify <m>\pi(R)</m> with <m>R</m>, and we will write <m>\pi(r)=\overline{r}=r</m> for all <m>r\in R</m>. 
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            For all <m>g\in R[x]</m> we have <m>\overline{g}=\overline{r}</m>, where <m>r</m> is the remainder upon division of <m>g</m> by <m>f</m>.

                        <p>
                            Every element of <m>R[x]/(f)</m> can be written in the form

                            and this representation is unique in the following sense: we have <m>\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}r_k\overline{x}^k=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}s_k\overline{x}^k</m> with <m>r_k, s_k\in \pi(R)</m> if and only if <m>r_k=s_k</m> for all <m>k</m>.
